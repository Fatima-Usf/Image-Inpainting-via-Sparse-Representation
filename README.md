# Image-Inpainting-via-Sparse-Representation

- a project proposed by the assistant professor 'Nicolas Baskiotis' specialized in data science and machine learning at Sorbonne university 

- The main aim of the project is : 

   1. to tackle a classical machine learning task in computer vision which is called " impainting " .
   2. get in touch with papers ( especially one considered as 'the reference' ) and implement it from scratch .
   3. comparing the two famous regularizations L2 ( Ridge ) and L1 ( LASSO ) in this particular problem and fine-tuning hyper-parameters 

- Inpainting is a classical computer vision problem , its goals is to fill blackholes and missing pixels of a bruited a image in a way that keep the image visually realistic with a smooth  texture !
